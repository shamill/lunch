> <!-- .element style="font-size: 80%;" --> JavaScript is everywhere, but too often it's locked in computers and phones. We need to bridge the gap between the physical world and your computer... It's time to alter the world around us with JavaScript! In previous JSConf talks Jan Jongboom ripped mainboards out of phones; abused sensors; and juggled devices, but this session is going to be harder, deeper, higher and more crazy! How about procedural music generated by the sensor data of all members of the audience? Using bluetooth beacons to find out if the person next to you is worth talking to? Hardware hacking your Firefox OS phone to add more sensors? Geofencing your newborn with a phone mainboard? And all of that... with JavaScript! Loaded with demo's this talk will forever change the way you think about JavaScript in the real world. LET'S DO THIS!

* Talked about sensory data, interfacing with physical interfaces (eg bluetooth), and controlling that all in a web browser with javascript
* Went over how to use sensors, and looking at strength in javascript data

> <!-- .element style="font-size: 80%;" --> With the amazing performance of modern single threaded JavaScript how can we catch up in parallelism? Today’s hardware provides specialized instructions that can operate on data in parallel and provides multiple execution units that can run code in parallel. The single threaded nature of classic JavaScript cannot take advantage of these resources. When quad-core smartphones are already available today that leaves a lot of performance potential on the table. I will share work we are doing to extend JavaScript with flexible and powerful primitives for parallelism that will unlock new performance opportunities to the Web. Let’s explore how native code concepts like shared memory and execution synchronization could work in JavaScript. With great power comes great responsibility so I will touch on some mitigation strategies we have in place to make sure tomorrow’s web applications stay well behaved as they use all the horsepower your hardware can provide.

* Good Spatial & Temporal
* Not so much in the middle

Why?

* Reading code is slow
* Interpreter in our head
* Should be part of our dev tools

> Our semi-yearly episode of NodeBots:Live! We'll have so much to talk (and dance) about! Want to be on the panel? Let me know: the@nodebotani.st

* Their summary was a little short, and website incomplete :), but the core concept is about getting together to make bots with javascript!
