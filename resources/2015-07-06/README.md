> <!-- .element style="font-size: 80%;" --> JavaScript is everywhere, but too often it's locked in computers and phones. We need to bridge the gap between the physical world and your computer... It's time to alter the world around us with JavaScript! In previous JSConf talks Jan Jongboom ripped mainboards out of phones; abused sensors; and juggled devices, but this session is going to be harder, deeper, higher and more crazy! How about procedural music generated by the sensor data of all members of the audience? Using bluetooth beacons to find out if the person next to you is worth talking to? Hardware hacking your Firefox OS phone to add more sensors? Geofencing your newborn with a phone mainboard? And all of that... with JavaScript! Loaded with demo's this talk will forever change the way you think about JavaScript in the real world. LET'S DO THIS!


### Including Sensory Data
* Talked about sensory data, interfacing with physical interfaces (eg bluetooth), and controlling that all in a web browser with javascript
* Went over how to use sensors, and looking at strength in javascript data 


### Making music with phones
* Went over sensory input with phones with javascript
* Interfaced with a presentation on stage that would make noises depending on rotation information from phone
** Too many people logged in and it didn't really work :)

### Scanning on Bluetooth

var adapter = navigator.mozBluetooth.defaultAdapter;
adapter.startLeScan([]).then(handle => {
    // Do stuff
});

### Tungsten.js: Virtual DOM + Server Rendering in a Legacy Codebase
* Andrew Rota
* Summary By: Nate Mielnik
* [Notes](https://github.com/nchase/talks/blob/master/2015/jsconf/12-B.md)


### Existing Architecture
* Performance was great
  * Server-side rendered templates, lazy loading resources, etc.
* DOM Manipulation bad
  * jQuery + Backbone = Overrendering
  * Have to think about low-level DOM performance (code review fights)


### Problems With Rewrites
* Expensive
* Break a lot of things
* Stall Developers


### Using Existing Infrastructure
* Back when we were laying phone line, but it was still expensive, they realized they could leverage barb wire fences as a way to transmit telephone signals or lay new phone lines
  * Farmers actually did this to create phone communcations
  * It's not perfect, but it's far less expensive when an ideal solution may be feasable for a long time


### What They Did
* Liked the idea of being able to look at individual components and pick libraries for each
* Used [Reactive](http://www.ractivejs.org/) to precompile Mustache templates into object, not strings
* Used the Virtual DOM library from [Mercury](https://github.com/Raynos/mercury)
* Used Backbone to bind events and handle data layer
* Wrote an integration library to put it all together ([Tungsten](https://github.com/wayfair/tungstenjs) -> open sourced)

### Drawing Hands: Built-ins written in JavaScript
* [JOHN-DAVID DALTON](http://www.twitter.com/jdalton)
* Summary By: Patrick Cavanaugh
* [Notes](https://github.com/nchase/talks/blob/master/2015/jsconf/16-B.md)


> Learn about how browsers/engines leverage JavaScript to implement built-in APIs.


> JavaScript APIs are often implemented early by developers using “polyfills”, but browsers actually often implement them in JavaScript even when official support is added!


* `Array.prototype.indexOf`
* `Intl` - ECMAScript 5.1 Internationalization API


`mozilla-release/js/src/builtin/Array.js`:
<pre><code>/* ES5 15.4.4.15. */
function ArrayLastIndexOf(searchElement/*, fromIndex*/) {
    /* Step 1. */
    var O = ToObject(this);

    /* Steps 2-3. */
    var len = TO_UINT32(O.length);

    /* Step 4. */
    if (len === 0)
        return -1;

    /* Step 5. */
    var n = arguments.length > 1 ? ToInteger(arguments[1]) : len - 1;

    /* Steps 6-7. */
    var k;
    if (n > len - 1)
        k = len - 1;
    else if (n &lt; 0)
        k = len + n;
    else
        k = n;

    /* Step 8. */
    if (IsPackedArray(O)) {
        for (; k >= 0; k--) {
            if (O[k] === searchElement)
                return k;
        }
    } else {
        for (; k >= 0; k--) {
            if (k in O &amp;&amp; O[k] === searchElement)
                return k;
        }
    }

    /* Step 9. */
    return -1;
}</code></pre>


#### What's `IsPackedArray`?


`~/src/mozilla-release/ grep -F IsPackedArray -R js`:
<pre><code>js/src/builtin/Array.js:    if (IsPackedArray(O)) {
js/src/builtin/Array.js:    if (IsPackedArray(O)) {
js/src/builtin/Array.js:        if (IsPackedArray(O)) {
js/src/builtin/Array.js:        if (IsPackedArray(O)) {
js/src/jscntxt.h:bool intrinsic_IsPackedArray(JSContext* cx, unsigned argc, Value* vp);
js/src/vm/SelfHosting.cpp:js::intrinsic_IsPackedArray(JSContext* cx, unsigned argc, Value* vp)
js/src/vm/SelfHosting.cpp:    JS_FN("IsPackedArray",           intrinsic_IsPackedArray,           1,0),</code></pre>


#### Internationalization API

* Polyfill: https://github.com/andyearnshaw/Intl.js
* IE 11 implements native `Intl` support using JavaScript!
* Downsides:
    * Need to guard against user-space javascript code breaking the `Intl` API



### Parallelism experiments in JavaScript

> <!-- .element style="font-size: 80%;" --> With the amazing performance of modern single threaded JavaScript how can we catch up in parallelism? Today’s hardware provides specialized instructions that can operate on data in parallel and provides multiple execution units that can run code in parallel. The single threaded nature of classic JavaScript cannot take advantage of these resources. When quad-core smartphones are already available today that leaves a lot of performance potential on the table. I will share work we are doing to extend JavaScript with flexible and powerful primitives for parallelism that will unlock new performance opportunities to the Web. Let’s explore how native code concepts like shared memory and execution synchronization could work in JavaScript. With great power comes great responsibility so I will touch on some mitigation strategies we have in place to make sure tomorrow’s web applications stay well behaved as they use all the horsepower your hardware can provide.

Granularity
* Good Spatial & Temporal
* Not so much in the middle

Why?

* Reading code is slow
* Interpreter in our head
* Should be part of our dev tools
