> Through out history, JS has been pointed out as the villain when the matter is accessible websites. By presenting some tricks and techniques, we plan to provoke this discussion among developers, and show that Accessibility and JS may live together, as long as you take the right steps.



### Re-examining recipe search--a dash of sugar, just a smidgen of graph database

> <!-- .element style="font-size: 80%;" --> I’m starvin’. I throw open my laptop, and search by what I've got in the house to minimize me running to the store. I'm craving a flavor, not necessarily a cuisine. Some southern food has its origins in West African food. How do recipe searches address this? How do we combine curation of good recipe content with better search to avoid having to build a recommendation engine? In this talk, we’ll take a look at the current state of web recipe discovery and how I naively tried to come up with an alternative with brute JavaScript force and graph-databasing; like baking a souffle for a dinner party and doing a no-fall dance before it comes out of the oven. Plan for the worst and be delighted when it doesn’t happen(or chuckle when it does)!

> <!-- .element stye="font-size: 80%;" --> I made the open source project Babel and will be presenting on how JavaScript transformation and ES6 can help improve developer workflow and how it can futureproof their code. Not only transpilation to ES6 but how Babel has support for Flow, JSX and React so it can be integrated into many workflows extremely nicely. There are many challenges associated with transforming JavaScript as well as AST manipulation that I think would be extremely beneficial for the average developer to know about. There's even crazy stuff like transpiling proxies/Object.observe which wraps every single expression in a method.

> In the amount of time it would take to have a pizza delivered, I'll teach you about accessibility through JavaScript testing. By using a pragmatic approach to software quality, we can create a more inclusive Web. Take it from someone who has broken high-profile builds: you can win by automating tests for common accessibility problems and catching them before they are deployed out into the world.
