## Facts

- <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> The book is short: roughly ~25% of 50% of 288 pages.
- <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Second half: all scenarios and suggestions based on the first half.
- <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> _Motivation As An Operating System_ and _Motivation 3.0_ peppered throughout...

Note:

- The real meat is in 150 pages, and the real meat of that
  is over a cluster of **just ~40 pages**
- Broad scope in scenarios (even schoolchildren). Really interesting to apply
  the new motivation model to unlikely scenarios/organizations.
- I found this metaphor really laborious.



## Intrinsic Motivation

- <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Harlow's Motivation experiment (1949)
- <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Deci's Motivation experiment (1969)

Note:

- "Intrinsic Reward" experiment with monkey and latch
- Two groups of humans experiment with puzzle, money as reward



## Three Elements: Autonomy, Purpose, Mastery

- Autonomy: "Self-direction and control are important"
- <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Purpose: the desire to do something "larger"
- <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Mastery: the desire to improve

Note:

- Purpose is challenging, hard to pinpoint. You need to find something that is broad
  and that resonates with people at the level of the business. More and more you see
  purpose-driven messages from organizations. Here we have e.g. "we want to
  help microbusinesses with their marketing materials at prices that make sense for them
  so that they can achieve their dreams"
- Mastery might be a challenging one to help people pinpoint if they're humble
  or if they understand the asymptotic nature of mastery (you can never get there).
  Maybe instead of probing around "what do you think you've mastered", we can probe around
  "In what scenarios or environments do you achieve flow" to find out where people are.
