# Preamble

- Big Thanks to Hackner, Thomas <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- "Lunch Talk Season Has Returned!" <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Anyone can present, share, learn
  - https://github.com/websdev/lunch
- <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Excited into action?

Note:

1. Slide tool exists. A couple of recent improvements make it easier to write custom presenters.
2. Oddly enough, VP sent out an email about Lightning Talk season being back.
   I swear I didn't know about it or have anything to do with it. Still digesting that.
3. I think we're going to be horribly light today, so please jump in!
